# 3D-Spatial-Mapping-Device

The 3D Spatial Mapping device is an embedded system which creates a 3D representation of the environment in which the system is situated in. There are various components of this embedded system including the SimpleLink MSP432E401Y microcontroller, ToF sensor (VL43L1X), MOT-28BYJ48 stepper motor, push-button, and PC data processing.

The languages used to process the data achieved through I2C and UART sertial communication is Python. The libraries used are Open3d, PySerial, and NumPy. More information about this project is availible in a data sheet created for this device named 3D Spatial Mapping Device Data Sheet.pdf.
